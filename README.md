# DiCorona? Covid Chatbot

## Our Goal

We aim to create a companion app that will assist COVID-19 patients and people who
are worried about the issue, the app is composed of 3 parts, an assistant chatbot,
a CT scan analyzer and a lab results analyzer.
Utilizing different methods of AI in NLP and image processings, this app aims to
aid people who have troubles visiting doctors and hospitals.

## The application

The app is built upon the Flash Chat app provided in Angela Yu's course on Udemy, we
followed through with her steps and added our features by substituting other's messages with
the bot's messages. We will build new screens from scratch for image scanning and manual inputs
for the results analyzer.
